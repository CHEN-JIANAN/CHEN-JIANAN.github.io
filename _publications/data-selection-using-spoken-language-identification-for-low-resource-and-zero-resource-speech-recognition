# excerpt: 'Large-scale pre-trained models have become com-
mon for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. They utilize
large-scale, multilingual datasets to learn acoustic features and
then are finetuned on downstream ASR tasks. However, their
performance degrades when applied to low-resource and zero-
resource languages lacking data. This paper introduces a new
data selection method with Spoken Language Identification (SLI)
models to bring non-target language speech data into training.
With the help of phonetic labels as a universal intermediate
representation to link low-resource languages to those with rich
resources, we enhance the ASR systemâ€™s performance on low-
resource and even zero-resource languages. We conducted ASR
experiments on Marathi, Assamese, and Panjabi with augmented
non-target Hindi data in the CommonVoice corpora. The exper-
imental results show that the proposed method can train ASR
systems with little target language resource.'
